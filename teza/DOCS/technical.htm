<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All the research work was programmed in the
<A HREF="../../../../../java.sun.com/default.htm">JAVA</A> programming language developed by
Sun microsystems.&nbsp; The test runs were performed using the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) with the most recent version (1.1.4) of the Just In Time
Compiler (JIT).&nbsp; The JIT compiler runs about 3 times slower than C++
code.&nbsp; Therefore the time constraint issues we encountered would not
have been helped much by the use of C code since our code sets were expanding
rates higher than 3x.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The hardware used was a Pentium 100 notebook
computer with 24 meg of RAM.
