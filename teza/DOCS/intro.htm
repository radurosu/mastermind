<CENTER>Introduction - The game of mastermind</CENTER>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The game of Mastermind, produced by Invicta
Plastics Ltd., is a deductive game for two players - the codemaker and
the codebreaker.&nbsp; The codemaker chooses a secret code consisting of
four pegs out of&nbsp; six possible colors. Repeated colors are allowed,
so the set of possible codes is 1296.&nbsp; The codebreaker repeatedly
guesses at the correct code and after each guess, receives input from the
codemaker about how close the guess is to the secret code. The codemaker's
input consists of black and white pegs; a black peg means that a peg in
the codebreaker's guess is correct in both color and position; a white
peg means&nbsp; that a peg in the guess is correct in color but not in
position; and finally, no pegs means that there are peg(s) in the guess
which are of the wrong color altogether.&nbsp; The purpose of the game
is to solve the code (i.e. get four black pegs) in the smallest number
of guesses.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Interest in the game has lead to the development
of&nbsp; a JAVA <A HREF="../../../../../www.unc.edu/~radu/mm">applet</A> that simulates
the Mastermind. Algorithms that solve a 6 color/4 positions mastermind
code have been developed.&nbsp;&nbsp; The algorithms brought to light a
very surprising result - that the most simple strategy gives results within
97% of the optimum.&nbsp; This revelation has inspired the expansion of
the mastermind problem to an <I>m</I> colors and <I>n</I> positions case.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This paper discuses research done on the performance
of&nbsp; algorithms over a wide range of <I>m's</I> and <I>n's</I>.&nbsp;
We sought to find out whether the basic algorithm that gave the excellent
results in the 6 color 4 position case performed just as well in larger
code set spaces (more colors and/or positions). Detailed descriptions of
each algorithm are given, and algorithm optimization is discussed. We also
display 3D graphs of&nbsp; the results achieved so far.
