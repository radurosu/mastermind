MasterMind is one of those brain intensive little games that I played while
was a little boy. The game can be played in many ways, the most common of
which I have programmed here. One playing this game on the computer is
commonly refered to as the Mind, while the computer plays the Master.
As the mind, your purpose is to find the four peggs put in by the computer
in the secret box at the bottom of the board.
